<h1>BlackJack Card Game on Python</h1>
<p><br>
Hello everyone,this is my fourth project and third game. This time I have completed a project on Python. This is a simple BlackJack game.<br>
<br>
Let's learn about this game and its rules :<br><br>
The North American game of Blackjack, also known as 21, has been one of the most popular casino games of the last hundred years and has spread throughout the world. In the 21st century it has been overtaken in popularity by Slots (slot machine games), but it remains one of the most popular casino card games and is available in almost all casinos both on and offline.<br>
<br>
Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other. The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting).<br>
<br>
At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each. The players' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (called the hole card) and one face up. The best possible Blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card.<br>
<br>
The house advantage of this game is derived from several rules that favour the dealer. The most significant of these is that the player must act before the dealer, allowing the player to bust and lose their bet before the dealer plays.<a href="https://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html">Reference</a><br>
